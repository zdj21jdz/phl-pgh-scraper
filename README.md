# PHL/PGH Scrapper - Scrapping info from the internet about Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
This is a small project for me to practice scraping different sites to grab info about the city I currently live in (Philly) and the city I grew up in (Pitt).

I'll be scraping info from the following locations:<br>
Pittsburgh:
1. Top news stories from WTAE feed
2. Weather from the openweathermap API
3. TODO - ESPN for Sport updates

Philadelphia:
1. Top news stories from 6abc feed
2. Weather from openweathermap API
3. TODO - ESPEN for Sport updates

Note that both Pittsburgh and Philly use the open weather API key. If you wish to run the weather portion of the script, make sure generate a key, and then run the following in your terminal:<br>
export OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=<your API_KEY here>
